# dpWebClone

This project is a clone of the Dubai Police website homepage (https://www.dubaipolice.gov.ae/wps/portal/home) built using HTML and CSS. It aims to replicate the design and partial functionality of the original website as a learning exercise in front-end web development.

Note: The website is not completely responsive. It is still a work-in-progress.
